        <h1>AmpDamp</h1>

<p>
AmpDamp is a tool that lets you adjust who and what you want to listen to, in real time, giving you the ability to tune out irrelevant topics, posts, or users. AmpDamp is a physical knob that allows you to control and modulate the volume of your Twitter stream. Turning the knob allows you to amplify or dampen particular voices or topics in your feed  and focus your attention on what matters. Because AmpDamp has been developed as a Chrome extension, we anticipate that in the future it will be able to be used across a range of social media content, from your newsfeed to your inbox.</p>

<p>You can read more about AmpDamp can help you learn with polyphony in the 2013 iConference <a href="http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/handle/2142/42533">proceedings</a>.</p>
