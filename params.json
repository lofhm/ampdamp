{"name":"Ampdamp","tagline":"A github repository for the ampdamp project","body":"# AmpDamp\r\n![AmpDamp Logo](http://raw.github.com/lofhm/ampdamp/gh-pages/ampdamp.png)\r\nAmpDamp is a tool that lets you adjust who and what you want to listen to, in real time, giving you the ability to tune out irrelevant topics, posts, or users. AmpDamp is a physical knob that allows you to control and modulate the volume of your Twitter stream. Turning the knob allows you to amplify or dampen particular voices or topics in your feed  and focus your attention on what matters. Because AmpDamp has been developed as a Chrome extension, we anticipate that in the future it will be able to be used across a range of social media content, from your newsfeed to your inbox.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about AmpDamp can help you learn with polyphony in the 2013 iConference [proceedings](https://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/handle/2142/34705).\r\n\r\n## About Us\r\nAmpDamp was created by a group of interdisciplinary scholars with backgrounds in design, information studies, digital humanities, archives, and new media. \r\n\r\n[Amelia Acker](http://www.ameliaacker.com/) is a PhD candidate at UCLA, Information Studies and studies electronic records, digital archives and mobile technologies.\r\n\r\n[Matt Burton](http://twitter.com/mcburton) is a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI).
